Code review instructions.
Need:
- Linux machine (terminal)
- python3 with numpy and matplotlib

We made three interesting figures to showcase our model: action_potential.svg, temperature_exp.svg, verification.svg.
All the figures can be reproduces using the GUI, which is started by running 'python3 gui.py' from the 'code/' folder.
This will open a window where a bunch of paramaters can be filled. Do not change any of the default parameters,
as these values are used to genereate the three figures in this folder. If you accidently change some values,
simply close the GUI with the 'Quit' button and run 'python3 gui.py' again. The default values will be restored that way.

1. action_potential.svg
To reproduce 'action_potential.svg':
a) open a terminal and navigate to the 'code/' folder.
    (From the folder in which this file is: 'cd code/'.)
b) run 'python3 gui.py'
c) There are four buttons on the screen: press 'Option 1 Simulate action potential'.
d) Wait for a couple of seconds.

2. temperature_exp.svg
To reproduce 'temperature_exp.svg':
a) open a terminal and navigate to the 'code/' folder.
    (From the folder in which this file is: 'cd code/'.)
b) run 'python3 gui.py'
c) There are four buttons on the screen: press 'Option 2 Run temperature experiments'.
d) Wait for some time (see terminal for progress).

3. verification.svg
To reproduce 'verification.svg':
a) open a terminal and navigate to the 'code/' folder.
    (From the folder in which this file is: 'cd code/'.)
b) run 'python3 gui.py'
c) There are four buttons on the screen: press 'Model verification'.
d) Wait for some time (see terminal for progress).
Note: this figure takes the longest time to reproduce.
