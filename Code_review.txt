Code review instructions
Needed:
- Linux machine (terminal);
- python3 with following modules, which UvA students should automatically have:
    - numpy
    - matplotlib (pyplot)
    - csv
    - os

We made two interesting figures to showcase our model (which can be found in the
folder 'figures/review_figures' or in the README on github.com): large_temp_exp.svg, multipe_ap.svg.

Both figures are generated by the 'poster_figures.py' script
in the 'code' folder. There is a fast way to reproduce
these figures, using data present in a csv file in the 'code' folder (this
data is for 'large_temp_exp.svg', data for 'multiple_ap.svg' is not stored),
and there is a slow way to reproduce the figures, by running
all experiments yourself (which will recalculate the data
present in the csv file).

First clone this repository and go to the root folder of the repository.

### Fast: reproduce figures using csv
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the 'code/' folder.
    (From the folder in which this file is: `cd code/`.)
2. Run: `python3 poster_figures.py`
3. Wait for a couple of seconds: first the 'multiple_ap.svg' figure is shown.
    Compare it as you like and close the figure (by pressing q or using the x on the window).
4. Now 'large_temp_exp.svg' is shown.

### Slow: recalculate data and show figures
*Note: The temperature experiments take quite a long time to finish.*
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the 'code/' folder.
    (From the folder in which this file is: `cd code/`.)
2. Open a python interpreter (run `python3`)
3. Import poster_figures.py:
    ```
    import poster_figures as posterf
    ```
4. To generate 'multiple_ap.svg' run the following:
    ```
    posterf.multiple_ap_plot()
    ```
5. To generate 'large_temp_exp.svg' run the following *(and wait for a very long time):*
    ```
    posterf.large_temp_exp()
    ```
6. To show 'large_temp_exp.svg' the fast way, using the data from the csv file 'results_100_deter_1.csv', run the following:
    ```
    posterf.plot_temp_exp_polyfit()
    ```

If you are interested in doing your own experiments with
the Hodgkin & Huxley model (by changing
certain parameters of the model to run temperature experiments
or simulate action potentials), you can use our graphical
user interface. This GUI is started by running `python3 gui.py` from inside the 'code/' folder.
This will open a window where a bunch of paramaters can be filled and buttons can be pressed to generate figures.
