MARK: GUI
-> Run one action potential and show plot
Want to be able to change:
    - Temperature
    - Use Euler or RK4 + size of time steps
    - How long to run
    - Amount of injected current (choice between constant current or injection of current at some time for some time?)

-> Run temperature experiments
Want to be able to change:
    - Which temperatures (min, max, amount)
    - Use Euler or RK4 + size of time steps
    - Tolerance for resting potential
    - Runtime per experiment
    - Amount of injected current (...)

JIM: EXPERIMENTS
-> Find pique value and duration of one action potential (including polarisation, depolarisation & hyperpolarisation phases)
-> A way to store results (.csv file?)
-> Plotting functions
-> Communicate with Mark as to which features are needed in the testing function
